# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Pre-Requisites
**Connector**: Have at least one of the below supported Fivetran ad platform connectors syncing data into your warehouse. This package currently supports:
    - [Amazon Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/amazon-ads)
    - [Apple Search Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads)
    - [Facebook Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads)
    - [Google Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/google-ads)
    - [LinkedIn Ad Analytics](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/linkedin-ads)
    - [Microsoft Advertising](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/microsoft-advertising)
    - [Pinterest Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/pinterest-ads)
    - [Reddit Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/reddit-ads)
    - [Snapchat Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/snapchat-ads)
    - [TikTok Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/tiktok-ads)
    - [Twitter Ads](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/twitter-ads)
> While you need only one of the above connectors to utilize this package, we recommend having at least two to gain the rollup benefit of this package.

- **Database support**: This package has been tested on **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **Postgres** and **Databricks**. Ensure you are using one of these supported databases.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` as well as the `calogica/dbt_expectations` then the `google_ads_source` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']

  - macro_namespace: dbt_expectations
    search_order: ['google_ads_source', 'dbt_expectations']
```

## Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following github package version in your `packages.yml`
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/ad_reporting
    version: [">=1.7.0", "<1.8.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```

Do NOT include the individual ad platform packages in this file. The ad reporting package itself has dependencies on these packages and will install them as well.


## Step 3: Configure Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package looks for your ad platform data in your target database. If this is not where your app platform data is stored, add the relevant `<connector>_database` variables to your `dbt_project.yml` file (see below).

```yml
vars:
    amazon_ads_schema: amazon_ads
    amazon_ads_database: your_database_name

    apple_search_ads_schema: apple_search_ads
    apple_search_ads_database: your_database_name

    facebook_ads_schema: facebook_ads
    facebook_ads_database: your_database_name 

    google_ads_schema: google_ads
    google_ads_database: your_database_name 

    microsoft_ads_schema: bingads
    microsoft_ads_database: your_database_name

    linkedin_ads_schema: linkedin_ads 
    linkedin_ads_database: your_database_name  

    pinterest_schema: pinterest
    pinterest_database: your_database_name 

    reddit_ads_schema: reddit_ads
    reddit_ads_database: your_database_name 

    snapchat_schema: snapchat_ads
    snapchat_database: your_database_name 
    
    tiktok_ads_schema: tiktok_ads
    tiktok_ads_database: your_database_name

    twitter_ads_schema: twitter_ads
    twitter_ads_database: your_database_name  
```

## Step 4: Enabling/Disabling Models
This package takes into consideration that not every account will have every feature enabled per platform. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in your respective ad platforms or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs. 

### Disable Platform Specific Reporting
If you would like to disable all reporting for any specific platform, please include the respective variable(s) in your `dbt_project.yml`. 

```yml
vars:
  ad_reporting__amazon_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__apple_search_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__facebook_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__google_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__linkedin_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__microsoft_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__pinterest_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__reddit_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__snapchat_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__tiktok_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  ad_reporting__twitter_ads_enabled: False # by default this is assumed to be True
```
### Enable/Disable Specific Reports within Platforms
For **Apple Search Ads**, if you are not utilizing the search functionality, you may choose to update the respective variable below.

For **Pinterest Ads**, if you are not tracking keyword performance, you may choose to update the corresponding variable below.

For **Twitter Ads**, if you are not tracking keyword performance, you may choose to update the corresponding variable below.

Add the following variables to your dbt_project.yml file

```yml
vars:
  apple_search_ads__using_search_terms: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  pinterest__using_keywords: False # by default this is assumed to be True
  twitter_ads__using_keywords: False # by default this is assumed to be True
```

## (Recommended) Step 5: Change the Build Schema
By default this package will build all models in your `<target_schema>` with the respective package suffixes (see below). This behavior can be tailored to your preference by making use of custom schemas. If you would like to override the current naming conventions, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file and rename `+schema` configs:

```yml
models:  
  ad_reporting:
    +schema: ad_reporting

  amazon_search_ads:
    +schema: amazon_ads
  amazon_ads_source:
    +schema: amazon_ads_source

  apple_search_ads:
    +schema: apple_search_ads
  apple_search_ads_source:
    +schema: apple_search_ads_source
  
  facebook_ads:
    +schema: facebook_ads
  facebook_ads_source:
    +schema: facebook_ads_source
  
  google_ads:
    +schema: google_ads
  google_ads_source:
    +schema: google_ads_source

  linkedin:
    +schema: linkedin
  linkedin_source:
    +schema: linkedin_source

  microsoft_ads:
    +schema: microsoft_ads
  microsoft_ads_source:
    +schema: microsoft_ads_source

  pinterest:
    +schema: pinterest
  pinterest_source:
    +schema: pinterest_source

  reddit_ads:
    +schema: reddit_ads
  reddit_ads_source:
    +schema: reddit_ads_source

  snapchat_ads:
    +schema: snapchat_ads
  snapchat_ads_source:
    +schema: snapchat_ads_source
  
  tiktok_ads:
    +schema: tiktok_ads
  tiktok_ads_source:
    +schema: tiktok_ads_source
  
  twitter_ads:
    +schema: twitter_ads
  twitter_ads_source:
    +schema: twitter_ads_source
```

> Provide a blank `+schema: ` to write to the `target_schema` without any suffix.

## (Optional) Step 6: Additional configurations
### Union multiple connectors
If you have multiple ad reporting connectors in Fivetran and would like to use this package on all of them simultaneously, we have provided functionality to do so. The package will union all of the data together and pass the unioned table into the transformations. You will be able to see which source it came from in the `source_relation` column of each model. To use this functionality, you will need to set either the `<package_name>_union_schemas` OR `<package_name>_union_databases` variables (cannot do both) in your root `dbt_project.yml` file. Below are the variables and examples for each connector:

```yml
vars:
    amazon_ads_union_schemas: ['amazon_ads_usa','amazon_ads_canada']
    amazon_ads_union_databases: ['amazon_ads_usa','amazon_ads_canada']

    apple_search_ads_union_schemas: ['apple_search_ads_usa','apple_search_ads_canada']
    apple_search_ads_union_databases: ['apple_search_ads_usa','apple_search_ads_canada']

    facebook_ads_union_schemas: ['facebook_ads_usa','facebook_ads_canada']
    facebook_ads_union_databases: ['facebook_ads_usa','facebook_ads_canada']

    google_ads_union_schemas: ['google_ads_usa','google_ads_canada']
    google_ads_union_databases: ['google_ads_usa','google_ads_canada']

    linkedin_ads_union_schemas: ['linkedin_usa','linkedin_canada']
    linkedin_ads_union_databases: ['linkedin_usa','linkedin_canada']

    microsoft_ads_union_schemas: ['microsoft_ads_usa','microsoft_ads_canada']
    microsoft_ads_union_databases: ['microsoft_ads_usa','microsoft_ads_canada']

    pinterest_ads_union_schemas: ['pinterest_usa','pinterest_canada']
    pinterest_ads_union_databases: ['pinterest_usa','pinterest_canada']

    reddit_ads_union_schemas: ['reddit_ads_usa','reddit_ads_canada']
    reddit_ads_union_databases: ['reddit_ads_usa','reddit_ads_canada']

    snapchat_ads_union_schemas: ['snapchat_ads_usa','snapchat_ads_canada']
    snapchat_ads_union_databases: ['snapchat_ads_usa','snapchat_ads_canada']

    tiktok_ads_union_schemas: ['tiktok_ads_usa','tiktok_ads_canada']
    tiktok_ads_union_databases: ['tiktok_ads_usa','tiktok_ads_canada']

    twitter_ads_union_schemas: ['twitter_usa','twitter_canada']
    twitter_ads_union_databases: ['twitter_usa','twitter_canada']
```
Please be aware that the native `source.yml` connection set up in the package will not function when the union schema/database feature is utilized. Although the data will be correctly combined, you will not observe the sources linked to the package models in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This happens because the package includes only one defined `source.yml`.

To connect your multiple schema/database sources to the package models, follow the steps outlined in the [Union Data Defined Sources Configuration](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.4.latest#union_data-source) section of the Fivetran Utils documentation for the union_data macro. This will ensure a proper configuration and correct visualization of connections in the DAG.

## Adding custom metrics to final reports

By default, this package selects `clicks`, `impressions`, and `cost` metrics from the upstream Ad platform reports. Additionally, each specific upstream Ad platform package allows for custom passthrough metrics to be included in the individual platform's final reports. You can find a complete list of available passthrough metric variables for each platform by referring to the relevant links below and inspecting the additional configurations for each platform:
    - [Amazon Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_amazon_ads#optional-step-5-additional-configurations)
    - [Apple Search Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Facebook Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Google Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [LinkedIn Ad Analytics](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Microsoft Advertising](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_microsoft_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Pinterest Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_pinterest#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Reddit Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_reddit_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Snapchat Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [TikTok Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_tiktok_ads#optional-step-4-additional-configurations)
    - [Twitter Ads](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twitter#optional-step-5-additional-configurations)

Furthermore, this package allows you to include these configured upstream passthrough metrics in the final roll-up models of the combined Ad Reporting package. To include passthrough metrics in the respective final models, you need to define the following `ad_reporting__*` variables in your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  ad_reporting__account_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: conversions
    - name: view_through_conversions
  ad_reporting__campaign_passthrough_metrics: 
    - name: total_shares
    - name: conversions
  ad_reporting__ad_group_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: conversions
    - name: interactions
  ad_reporting__ad_passthrough_metrics: ## For both Ad and URL reports
    - name: conversions
    - name: video_views_captured
  ad_reporting__keyword_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: interactions
  ad_reporting__search_passthrough_metrics:
    - name: conversions
    - name: local_spend_amount
```
It is important to ensure that if you want to configure a passthrough metric for an ad reporting end model, that metric **must** be included in all of your upstream variables. Additionally, the name of the metric **must** be consistent across platforms. If a certain upstream platform does not include the metric you **must** include a `transform_sql` argument to pass a null value through (see below for examples). The following configuration is an example when using the Microsoft Ads, Apple Search Ads, Google Ads, Snapchat Ads, TikTok Ads, and Reddit Ads platforms within a `dbt_project.yml` file:

>**Note**: Please ensure you exercised due diligence when adding metrics to these models. The metrics added by default (`clicks`, `impressions`, and `cost`) have been vetted by the Fivetran team maintaining this package for accuracy. There are metrics included within the source reports, for example metric averages, which may be inaccurately represented at the grain for reports created in this package. You will want to ensure whichever metrics you pass through are indeed appropriate to aggregate at the respective reporting levels provided in this package.

>**Note**: While the below configuration is only for a subset of Ad platforms, the same strategy will be used for all other possible combinations of upstream Ad platform dependencies.

```yml

    - name: conversions
    - name: local_spend_amount
```

## Disabling null URL filtering from URL reports
The default behavior for the `ad_reporting__url_report` end model is to filter out records having null URL fields, however, you are able to turn off this filter if needed. To turn off the filter, include the below in your `dbt_project.yml` file. This variable will affect ALL Fivetran platform packages enabled in Ad Reporting, therefore either all URL reports will have null URLs filtered, or all URL reports will have null URLs included.

```yml
vars:
  ad_reporting__url_report__using_null_filter: False # Default is True.
```

### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable. This is not available for sources in which you are unioning together multiple connectors.
> IMPORTANT: See the Apple Store [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_store_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml)  and Google Play [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_play_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.
    
```yml
vars:
    <default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 8: Use predefined Metrics and the dbt Semantic Layer
<details><summary>Expand for details</summary>

On top of the `ad_reporting__ad_report` final model, the Ad Reporting dbt package defines common [Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/build-metrics-intro) using [MetricFlow](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow) that can be queried with the [dbt Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/dbt-sl). These metrics include:
- Spend
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Cost per click
- Clickthrough rate
- Bounce rate
- Count of active ads
- Average spend
- Average non-zero spend

You can find the supported dimensions and full definitions of these metrics [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/blob/main/models/ad_reporting_metrics.yml), and the semantic model definitions [here](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting/blob/main/models/metrics/models/semantic_models/ad_reporting__ad_report.yaml).

Refer to the Semantic Layer [quickstart guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/quickstart-sl) for instructions on how to get setup with the dbt Semantic Layer and start querying these metrics.

**Metricflow Time Spine Configuration**
This package includes a model called `metricflow_time_spine.sql` that MetricFlow requires to build cumulative metrics. Documentation on the metricflow time spine model can be [found here.](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/metricflow-time-spine) If you have already configured a metricflow time spine model in your project, you will need to disable the one in this package by defining the `ad_reporting__metricflow_time_spine_enabled` variable as `false` in your project.

```yml
## root dbt_project.yml
vars:
  ad_reporting__metricflow_time_spine_enabled: false ## true by default
```
Additionally, the `dbt_date.get_base_dates` macro is used in the generation of the `metricsflow_time_spine.sql` model. This macro requires the `dbt_date:time_zone` variable to be defined in the project to generate a time spine based on the defined time zone. The default value in this package is `America/Los_Angeles`. However, you may override this variable in your own project if you wish. 

>**Note**: This variable is defined under the `ad_reporting` hierarchy within this package and should not adjust any local global variable values in your project if you already have this variable defined. For more information on why this variable is needed and the different value options, refer to the [dbt-date package documentation](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date#variables).

```yml
## root dbt_project.yml
vars:
  "dbt_date:time_zone": "America/Chicago" # Default is "America/Los_Angeles"
```

**Semantic Manifest**
You may notice a new run artifact called `semantic_manifest.json`. This file serves as the integation point between dbt-core and metricflow, and contains all the information MetricFlow needs to build a semantic graph, and generate SQL from query requests. You can learn more about the semantic manifest file [in the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud-apis/sl-manifest).

> **Note**: Metricflow is only supported in dbt>=v1.6.0, therefore, please take note of the correct dbt version.
